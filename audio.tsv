0	17760	If you would ask me, Colleen, what is your favorite place that you've ever been in your
17760	23680	life that you've traveled to, I would be able to tell you without a doubt my number one
24080	30400	spot on the earth is Greece. And there are three reasons why I would tell you that.
30400	38320	The first is that that country itself is a country of extraordinary beauty. I'm sure you've seen
38320	44960	movies or pictures of the Aegean Sea and all of the islands, the Greek islands, and it really does
44960	52160	look like that with that aquamarine water and those islands with those that real stark white
52160	57680	architecture and the blue roofs. And when the sun's shining down from the heavens,
57680	65520	it's absolutely breathtaking. And the city of Athens itself is a big city, but it's strange.
65520	72560	It has a really small town feel to it. There's just something about it when you're there.
72560	79040	You don't feel like you're in a massive city like New York or Chicago. And yet it is a big city.
79040	88000	And of course it has tremendous historical value and places that are so intact. You feel like you're
88000	93440	going back in time. It's a really tremendous city. The second thing about it was when I was there,
94080	99760	I have never been to a place where the people have been more friendly and have reached out
99760	106400	to us as just normal citizens visiting their country than what happened to us in Greece.
106400	112240	I had more conversations with just the local people than I ever have anywhere else. There was
112240	116960	something about them that they were really interested in us and they really just wanted
116960	123440	to get to know us wherever we wander in their country. But the third reason, and this is perhaps
123440	129680	the most important reason that Greece takes the top spot for me in all my travels, is that in the
129680	139280	10 days that I was in that country, I never once saw an ugly man. They were all gorgeous.
140720	153760	Everywhere we went, I was like, is there an ugly man in this country?
